# about-me

Hello, my name is Bruno Zhong. I am 7 1/2 years old (Wed Aug 19, 2020). 

This is my first year in GitHub. GitHub is better than html+css+js from [iii9i.com](http://iii9i.com/). Recently, html+css+js could only surport limted amouts of file extensions, but after I signed in to GitHub from [github.com](https:/github.com), I found out that was much better than html+css+js.

You can see my projects at [github.com/Brunozhon](https://github.com/Brunozhon). If you geessed the syntax more like github.com/ username, you are right.
